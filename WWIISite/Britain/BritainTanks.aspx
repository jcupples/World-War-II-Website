            Cruiser Mk VI Crusader (A15 Mk II)
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 1938, Nuffield Mechanizations and Aero Limited produced their A16 design for
            a heavy cruiser tank based on Christie suspension. Looking for a lighter and 
            cheaper tank to build, the General Staff requested alternatives. To this end 
            the A13 Mk III cruiser tank design which would enter service as the "Tank, 
            Cruiser Mk V" and known in service as "Covenanter" was designed. Nuffield were, 
            in 1939, offered the opportunity to take part in the production of Covenanter.

            Nuffield, however, preferred to work on its own version of the A13—though 
            they still provided design work for the Covenanter's turret. This new tank 
            was adopted as "Tank, Cruiser, Mk VI Crusader", under General Staff 
            specification A15. Although Crusader is often referred to as an improved 
            version of the Covenanter, in fact it was a parallel design. Both tanks 
            were ordered "off the drawing board" without building prototypes first. 
            Despite a later start, the pilot model of the Crusader was ready six weeks 
            before the first Covenanter.

            The Crusader had five road 
            wheels each side to improve weight distribution in a tank that weighed 
            almost 20 tons. The 
            810mm diameter wheels were of pressed steel with solid rubber tyres. 
            The hull sides were built up of two separated plates with the suspension 
            arms between them.

            With the Axis forces in North Africa having pushed the British back to the 
            Egyptian border and the remaining British armour being a mixed force of older 
            tanks with a few Matildas, tanks were hurriedly shipped via the Mediterranean 
            arriving on 12 May 1941. There were sufficient Crusaders to equip the 6th Royal 
            Tank Regiment which with the 2nd RTR (with older cruiser tanks) formed the 7th 
            Armoured Brigade. The rest of the tanks were Matildas for the 4th Armoured Brigade 
            giving the 7th Armoured division only four tank regiments. The 7th Brigade was 
            re-equipped with further Crusaders, but as the brigade had been expanded by the 
            addition of 7th Hussars there were not sufficient to replace the older cruiser tanks.

            Although the Crusader was faster than any tanks it opposed, its potential was limited 
            by a relatively light QF 2-pounder gun, thin armour and mechanical problems. A particular 
            tactical limitation was the lack of a high explosive shell for the main armament—these 
            existed but were never supplied. Axis tank forces developed an extremely effective method 
            of dealing with attacking tank forces by retiring behind a screen of concealed anti-tank 
            guns. The pursuing tanks could then be engaged by the artillery. With the German anti-tank 
            guns out of range of the tanks' machine guns and without a high explosive shell to return 
            fire, the tanks were left with the equally unpalatable options of withdrawing under fire 
            or trying to overrun the gun screen. Additionally, The Crusader proved prone to catch fire when hit, 
            a problem that was identified as due to the ammunition being ignited by hot metal 
            penetrating the unprotected racks. The angled underside of the turret created 
            "shell pockets" that acted as a lever for lifting the turret from its mounting 
            when struck by a shell.
        </p>

            Later in the campaign shipping was improved, Nuffields had put an engineering team in 
            Egypt, and crews were better at preventing problems, but the reputation of the Crusader 
            could not recover.

            The 1st Army converted to Shermans during Tunisia, but Crusaders remained in use with 
            the 8th for longer. The last major action for Crusaders was the Battle of Mareth. 
            The North Africa campaign finished shortly after.

           Infantry Mk IV Churchill (A22 Mk IV)
        </h3>

        <p>
             The hull was made up of simple flat plates which were initially bolted together and were 
             welded in later models. The hull was split into four compartments: the driver's position 
             at the front, then the fighting compartment including the turret, the engine compartment, 
             and the gearbox compartment. The suspension was fitted under the two large "panniers" on
             either side of the hull, the track running over the top. There were eleven bogies either 
             side, each carrying two 10-inch wheels. Only nine of the bogies were taking the vehicle 
             weight normally, the front coming into play when the vehicle nosed into the ground or 
             against an obstacle, the rear acting in part as a track tensioner. Due to the number of 
             wheels, the tank could survive losing several without much in the way of adverse effects 
             as well as traversing steeper terrain obstacles. As the tracks ran around the panniers, 
             escape hatches in the side could be incorporated into the design. These were retained 
             throughout the revisions of the Churchill and were of particular use when the Churchill 
             was adopted as the AVRE.

            The Dieppe Raid was planned to temporarily take control of the French port of Dieppe using 
            a strong force of about 6,000 troops – mostly drawn from inexperienced Canadian units. The 
            operation, codenamed Rutter, would test the feasibility of opposed landings. Nearly 60 Churchill 
            tanks from the Calgary Regiment were allocated to support the infantry and commandos; they would 
            be put ashore by landing craft. Some problems were anticipated and allowed for: waterproofing of 
            the hulls, canvas carpets to aid the tanks crossing the shingle beach, engineer teams to demolish 
            obstacles and a few of the tanks were fitted with flame-throwers.

            In the event, the German defences were strong and several tanks in each of the four "waves" were 
            lost on, or before reaching, the beach. Only fourteen got off the shore and past the sea wall. 
            Although effective in engaging the defenders in the town's buildings their progress was blocked 
            by concrete defences; the demolition teams – killed or pinned on the beach – had not been able 
            to accompany the tanks. Some tanks were able to return to the beach once a withdrawal had been 
            signalled but none were taken off.

           Six Mk III Churchills saw action in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. 
           This detachment, called "Kingforce", supported the attack of 7th Motor Brigade. The Churchills were fired 
           on many times by German anti-tank guns, but only one received more than light damage. One tank was said to
           have been hit up to 80 times.

           Kingforce was disbanded after El Alamein – it had been formed to test whether the Churchills could operate in Africa. 
           Instead a full Tank Brigade of three regiments was sent to Africa, and went into action in February 1943.

           In one encounter on 21 April 1943 during the start of the Battle of Longstop Hill a Churchill tank of the 48th Royal 
           Tank Regiment got the better of a German Tiger I heavy tank. A 6 pounder shot from the Churchill lodged between the 
           Tiger's turret and turret ring, jamming the turret and injuring the Tiger crew. The crew abandoned the Tiger, which 
           was subsequently captured by the British. Known as Tiger 131, this Tiger defeated by Churchill tanks was the first 
           captured by the Western Allies and was particularly useful for intelligence. It is now on display at Bovington Tank 
           Museum in the United Kingdom.

            In 1941, the Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in the United Kingdom set out to 
            design replacements for the aging Crusader cruiser tanks. After the Cavalier design, 
            which was largely unsuccessful, the Cruiser Mk VIII (A27) design emerged. The initial 
            models were equipped with the older and less-powerful Liberty engine; they were 
            designated A27L Centaur tanks. Starting in Jan 1943, the more powerful Meteor 
            engines became available, and those equipped with this engine type were designated
            A27M Cromwell tanks.

        <p>
            The Centaur tanks, with the weaker engines, were largely used for training purposes. 
            Some of them were converted to specialty uses, such as the conversion to become 
            armored bulldozers. A few of them saw combat as well, including the Normandy, 
            France landing operations in 1944. The Cromwell tanks were the more numerous of 
            the two variants. Similar to their Centaur cousins, the Cromwell tanks fielded 
            dual-purpose guns that could fire high explosive shells made for the American M3 
            75-mm gun, thus making them excellent infantry support tanks. Cromwell tanks 
            first saw action during the Normandy landing operations and were generally 
            well-received, though many British crews preferred the American Sherman tanks.

        <p>
            By the end of the war, a total of 4,016 Mk VIII tanks were built; 950 
            of them were of the Centaur variant and 3,066 were of the Cromwell variant. 
            Additionally, 375 Centaur hulls were built to receive anti-aircraft gun turrets, 
            though only 95 of them were completed. After the war, they remained in service 
            until the 1950s.
