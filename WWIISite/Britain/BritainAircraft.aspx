            The Supermarine Spitfire XIV
        </h3>
        <p>
            Designed by trophy-winning aircraft designer Reginald J. Mitchell and manufactured
            by Vickers-Armstrongs' subsidiary Supermarine, Spitfire fighters were made to be
            fast and maneuverable. The first prototype, K5054, took flight on 5 Mar 1936 at
            Eastleigh Aerodrome, Hampshire, England, United Kingdom; this first flight did not
            live up to Mitchell's expectations, but Mitchell knew that he had a good foundation
            to work with. After much hard work, it was finally accepted by the British Air Ministry;
            upon that time, director of Vickers-Armstrongs Sir Robert MacLean named it Spitfire,
            which was his daughter's nickname. The first order was placed on 3 Jun 1936 for
            310 units, and it took two years for Supermarine to prepare for full scale production
            thanks to the complex design. The wings, for example, were thin, covered with stressed
            metal skin, and of a revolutionary elliptical shape. Notably, it was reported that
            a German Bf 109 fighter took a third less time to build than a Spitfire aircraft.
            However, Supermarine was still able to produce them in great numbers. During the
            design's production life, 20,351 were built.

        <p>
            In late 1941, with the introduction of the Fw 190 fighters on the German side, Spitfire
            losses climbed until upgraded versions reached adequate numbers. To counter this
            disadvantage, some Spitfire Mk XII and Mk XIV were equipped with the new and more
            powerful Rolls-Royce Griffon engines, making them much more capable in low-level
            combat situations. The first of the Griffon-powered Spitfire fighters took flight
            on 27 Nov 1941, and the pilots of these new variants found themselves wielding effective
            weapons.

        <p>
            After the war, Spitfire aircraft were used in many air forces around the world,
            including Sweden, Italy, Israel, and many others. Some of them remained in service
            well into the 1960s. In the post-war age of jet fighters, many pilots remain attached
            to the Spitfire design.

            Bristol Beaufighter Mk. X
        </h3>

        <p>
            Built as a company-funded long-range fighter (using major components from the earlier
            Beaufort torpedo-bomber), the Beaufighter prototype first flew on July 17, 1939
            under the command of Captain Uwins. This was little more than eight months after
            the initial design had been approved, and two weeks before the first airplane even
            flew, a production order for 300 aircraft under specification F. 17/39 was granted.
            This seemingly desperate measure by the Air Ministry was, by 1938 to 1939, not uncommon,
            as it helped speed up the production of much-needed combat planes.

                ImageAlign="Right" />
        </p>

        <p>
            As production continued, additional versions appeared differing in engines installed
            and in other ways. Beaufighters were used in many theaters of war and for varied
            duties, performing particularly well in the Western Desert thanks to their long
            range. Coastal Command of the RAF received several torpedo-carrying versions which
            were responsible for sinking a great deal of enemy shipping. The last and most numerous
            was the superb Mk X, which could carry a large torpedo or bombs and rocket projectiles,
            and claimed among its victories several German submarines.
        </p>

        <p>
            To the Japanese, the Beaufighter became known as "The Whispering Death" which gives
            some idea of the speed at which one could suddenly appear, strike and turn for home.
            Beaufighters were also flown by the air forces of Australia, New Zealand and, in
            small numbers, the US. In Britain they remained flying as target tugs throughout
            the 1950s.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the last Beaufighter left the Bristol Aeroplane Company's Weston-super-Mare
            works on September 21, 1945, a total of 5,562 aircraft of this type had been produced
            in the United Kingdom. Of these some 2,231 were Mark Xs. During its operational
            career it had played a prime role in defeating the Luftwaffe's night "blitz" of
            1940-1941, and it had operated in every major campaign of the war, carrying out
            the last operational sortie of the European war, a strike against German shipping
            in the Skagerrak, and serving with distinction in the Pacific until the capitulation
            of Japan. The Beaufighter may have been the product of improvisation, but it was
            a remarkably successful one.

        <h3>
            Vickers Wellington Ic
        </h3>

        <p>
            he longest-serving of the trio of medium bombers with which Bomber Command at the
            outset of World War II, the Wellington, affectionately known as the 'Wimpey' by
            its crews, flew on many of the defining operations until its last bombing mission
            over the Reich in October 1943, although a few soldiered on with specialist units
            within the Command until January 1945.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Wellington can trace its origins back to 1932 when, in answer to Air Ministry
            Specification B9/32, Vickers proposed a twin-engined 'heavy' bomber with an empty
            weight of 6,500lbs. Utilising geodetic construction, a method of 'weaving' the individual
            struts of the fuselage structure to provide an incredibly resilient airframe, able
            to absorb tremendous damage, combined with a low weight penalty.
            The first aircraft took to the air some four years later in June 1936 and was, for
            a short time, known as the Vickers Crecy before the name Wellington was adopted.

            <asp:Image class="img2" ID="Wellington" runat="server" ImageUrl="~/images/Well1C.jpg"
                ImageAlign="Right" />
        </p>

        <p>
            The peak of the Wellington's service probably came in 1942, when just over half
            of the forces of the three 1,000-bomber raids flown in May and June was made up
            of Wellingtons.

            But with the arrival of the four-engined heavy bombers, the Wellington's days were
            numbered, but the type long out-lived the other twin-engined bombers with which
            Britain had taken the war to Germany in the first years of World War II, and is
            perhaps not given the recognition it deserves as the Lancaster and Mosquito 
            claimed the limelight in the second half of Bomber Command's war.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over 11,000 Wellingtons were built in total, many surviving past the end of the
            war mainly in second-line duties with the RAF into the 1950s. Others became test
            aircraft for a variety of engines and armament installations with Service and civilian
            companies.
