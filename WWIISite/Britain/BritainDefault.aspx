            The First to Respond to the Invasion of Poland
        </h3>
        <p>
            On September 1, 1939 German troops swarmed across the Polish border and unleashed
            the first Blitzkrieg the world had seen. Hitler had been planning his attack since
            March - ever since German troops occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia. The Poles
            suspected as much and readied their defenses. Unfortunately the Poles based their
            defensive strategy on the experiences of World War I. Mobility was crucial - mobility
            provided by cavalry troops the Poles considered the best in the world. Indeed, their
            horsemen were probably the world's best - but horses offered little defense against
            tanks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Britain and France had sworn to defend Poland. Honoring these obligations, the two
            countries sent ultimatums to Hitler demanding his withdrawal from Poland. Hitler
            declined to respond. On September 3, Prime Minister Chamberlain went to the airwaves
            to announce to the British people that a state of war existed between their country
            and Germany. World War II had begun.

        <h3>
            Battle of Britain
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Battle of Britain was a struggle between the German Luftwaffe and the British
            Royal Air force which raged over Britain between July and October 1940. The battle,
            which was the first major military campaign in history to be fought entirely in
            the air, was the result of a German plan to win air superiority over Southern Britain
            and the English Channel by destroying the British air force and aircraft industry.
            Hitler saw victory in the battle as a prelude to the invasion of Britain (codenamed
            Operation Sealion).</p>
        <p>
            The Luftwaffe’s first disadvantage was that it was neither trained nor equipped
            for the long range operations which became part of the battle. Its tactics were
            based upon the concept of close air support for ground forces; they were therefore
            ill-suited to the circumstances of the new campaign. The technical differences between
            the fighter aircraft employed by two sides were negligible: the RAF’s main fighter
            planes were the Spitfire and the Hurricane, whilst the Germans relied primarily
            on Messcherschmitt fighters and Junkers dive bombers. Yet to swing the odds in Britain’s
            favour, the tactical advantage that German fighters had developed in earlier conflicts
            was negated once fighter aircraft were ordered to provide close escort to the German
            bomber formations. These formations had discovered to their own extreme cost that
            they were unable to defend themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the battle, the RAF enjoyed the advantage of defending against attacks launched
            from widely separated airfields, thus profiting from what strategists call ‘interior
            lines’. This advantage was optimised by Britain’s system of radar tracking and guidance.
            Furthermore, the added comfort of fighting over friendly territory meant that pilots
            who crash-landed or parachuted out of their aircrafts could return to battle. British
            fortunes were also helped by the fact that the Luftwaffe had never subscribed to
            a concept of strategic bombing. British anti-aircraft and civil-defence preparations
            were inadequate in the summer of 1940, yet the Luftwaffe was unable to wreak the
            devastating effects feared by many.</p>
        <p>
            The climax of the battle came on 15 September, a day in which the Luftwaffe lost
            56 planes and the RAF 28. During the twelve-week battle, 1,733 German aircraft had
            been destroyed, compared with 915 British fighters. On 17 September, Hitler recognised
            the growing futility of the campaign and postponed indefinitely the invasion of
            Britain. Yet this did not mean an end to the bombing terror. German tactics were
            changed again and the Luftwaffe resorted to indiscriminate bombing of larger cities,
            including London, Plymouth and Coventry.</p>

            Victorious, But Not Without A Price
        </h3>
        <p>
            Tuesday 8 May 1945 was 'Victory in Europe' Day, and it marked the formal end of
            Hitler's war. With it came the end of six years of misery, suffering, courage and
            endurance across the world</p>
        <p>
            In much of Britain, VE Day was marked by street parties. The people of Britain badly
            needed to let their hair down. The country was war-weary by May 1945. There had
            been years of austerity and rationing: five inches of water to a bath, few eggs,
            no bananas and the motto 'make do and mend'.</p>
        <p>
            Half a million homes had been destroyed, and many millions of lives disrupted. Although
            the casualty lists from the battlefields were lower than in World War One, they
            were still terrible.
        </p>
        <p>
            All over the country people held fancy dress parades for children, got drunk, made
            a din, sang and danced in the streets, and went to church to give thanks to God
            for victory.</p>
        <p>
            For all too many people, mourning a loved one killed in service or in a German air
            raid, the moment of victory was bittersweet. For others, after the parties were
            over, there was a sense of anti-climax.</p>
        <p>
            The tension that had been there for six long years was suddenly relaxed. Some found
            that they had lost a sense of purpose in their lives, a feeling exacerbated by the
            austerity to come. The war had been won, but the peace did not promise to be easy.</p>
