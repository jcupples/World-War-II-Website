            LA-5FN
        </h3>
        <p>
            The request for this design was to build a fast, all-wooden fighter that could 
            be mass produced and still compete against the German Luftwaffe fighters, such as 
            the FW190. The design resulted in a light, capable aircraft in the first production 
            model LaGG-3, but would be hindered in performance by a vast combination of poor materials, 
            shoddy workmanship, heavy additions such as armor and radios, and technical problems like 
            leakages and engines overheating. On top of the technical issues, the fighter command 
            suffered from a lack of training with the new fighters and outdated tactics against the Germans. 
            The resulting performance earned the LaGG the nickname “Lakirovannyi, Garantirovannyi Grob” which 
            translates to “Guaranteed, Lacquered Coffin.”

        </p>

        <p>
            The biggest performance issue for the LaGG-3 was the underpowered Klimov M-105P engine. 
            To resolve this and add the necessary horsepower a radial engine, the Shvetsov M-82A was 
            adapted into the existing airframe. This new model became the LaG-5 in March 1942. 
            On 8 September 1942 the La-5 was introduced with only minor modifications to the control 
            surface and tail to account for increasing balance and control with the heavier weight of 
            the engine and various additions. The next upgrade would be in the engine, adding a supercharger 
            to boost the performance ceiling and the La-5F was gaining ground against the German opponents 
            capabilities. The last version of the 5 series was the La-5FN with again upgraded the engine by 
            the addition of a fuel injection system and better engine cooling.

        <p>
            The final version of the La-5(FN) had a powerplant that produced 1,850hp. 
            The dimensions of the plane are a span of 32ft 1.78in, length of 28ft 2.75in, 
            height of 8ft 4in and a wing area of 18.37sq ft. It weighed 6,173lb empty and 
            was 7,407lb loaded. The speed was a decent 403mph at 20,670ft with a somewhat 
            limited range of 360mi. The service ceiling was 31,170ft. With the limited weight 
            design the armament consisted only of 2x20mm ShVAK cannons.

           Il-2 Sturmovik
        </h3>

        <p>
             he Il-2 Shturmovik ground attack aircraft were designed by Sergey Ilyushin at 
             the Central Design Bureau in 1938, featuring a heavy armor shell that surrounded 
             the crews of two, the engines, the radiators, and the fuel tanks. The shells were 
             designed so they could deflect all small arms fire while the aircraft flew low to 
             the groud. The pilot's windscreen, too, were heavily armored. The prototype took 
             flight on 30 Dec 1939 and won the government contract, but a later requirement 
             led to the design of a single-seater version which took flight on 12 Oct 1940. 
             Production of the single-seater version began in 1941. By the time Germany 
             launched the invasion of Russia with Operation Barbarossa, 249 were available 
             for frontline use.

        </p>

        <p>
            The first combat missions for Il-2 aircraft were with the 4th ShAP over the Berezina 
            River in Jun 1941. Inexperience with this new design led to a high casualty rate of 
            10 aircraft out of a total of 65 by 10 Jul, but as pilots learned of the strengths and 
            weaknesses of Il-2 aircraft, their reputations grew. Soon, the aircraft were seen all 
            cross the Russian front, flying missions against German armor. Although they were 
            defensively capable enough to shoot down German Bf 109 fighters every so often, in 
            general Il-2 aircraft were vulnerable to German interceptors. As a result, in Feb 1942, 
            the two-seater version was brought back where the rear gunner could alleviate some of the 
            pressures that hostile pursuing fighters exerted. Because armor protection for rear gunners 
            was not introduced until the subsequent model Il-10 in 1944, casualty rate of rear gunners 
            was very high.
        </p>

        <p>
            Production of Il-2 aircraft was slow when the war broke out with Germany because the 
            factories were being relocated from Moscow region to the east of the Ural Mountains. 
            When the factories were re-established, production grew only slowly, and it took harsh 
            demands from Joseph Stalin for the factory managers to pick up their pace. As a result, 
            by the end of the war, over 30,000 Il-2 aircraft were built, making the design among the 
            most widely produced in military aircraft history.

            Pe-2 Peshka
        </h3>

        <p>
            The Pe-2 Petlyakov Pe-2 Peshka dive bombers were designed by inmates of a sharashka 
            in the Soviet Gulag labor camp system. Vladimir Petlyakov, imprisoned for delaying 
            design work on the ANT-42 bomber project, headed this project that was originally 
            put together to produce a design for fighter aircraft to escort bombers. When the 
            prototype flew on 22 Dec 1939, it featured advanced features such as a pressurized 
            cabin and many electrically-actuated systems. Just as the design was about to enter 
            production, a redesign was demanded in order to remedy the lack of dive bombers in 
            the Russian air force. Given 45 days to perform this redesign, Petlyakov removed the 
            pressurized cabin and the supercharger while adding dive brakes and space for two 
            additional crewmen. The end result was so impressive that Petlyakov was granted 
            freedom, and his name was allowed to be associated with the design, a credit so many 
            other sharashka engineers were deprived of. Without prototype testing, the dive bomber
            design entered production, and the first Pe-2 aircraft flew on 15 Dec 1940.

            <asp:Image class="img2" ID="Peshka" runat="server" ImageUrl="~/images/PE2.jpg"

        </p>

        <p>
            A unique characteristic of Pe-2 aircraft was the difficulty to get the aircraft 
            airborne during takeoff. Such a great force was required to pull the elevators up 
            that some pilots, notably some of the female pilots of the Russian military, were 
            unable to perform this task. When this occurred, the standard procedure was for the 
            bombardier to reach around the pilot seat and assist the pilot. Once airborne, they 
            enjoyed excellent flying characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Pe-2 dive bombers were highly effective when the Russian ground forces began 
            to push German invaders back. Their good flying characteristics allowed them to 
            make accurate bombing missions, while the ample speed allowed them to escape from 
            hostile interceptors. The design continued to improve throughout the war, too, with 
            direct input by the pilots who flew them.
            During the production life of this design, 11,400 aircraft were built across 
            numerous variants.
