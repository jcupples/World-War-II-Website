            T-26 Model 1933
        </h3>
        <p>
            The T-26 light tanks were developed by the OKMO of Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, 
            Russia based on the British firm Vickers-Armstrongs' Mk.E 6-ton light tank design, 
            purchased by Russia in 1930. Production began on 26 Jan 1931, and the first examples 
            entered service on 13 Feb. As time went on in the 1930s, the T-26 design slowly grew 
            apart from the original British design. In 1931, the machine gun turrets' firing 
            ports were converted from their original circular shape to a rectangular shape in 
            order to better accommodate Degtyarev machine guns. In Mar 1932, air intake 
            systems were upgraded to deal with snow. In 1933, the T-26 Model 1933 variant 
            design was unveiled, which upgraded the design's primary weapon from two machine 
            guns to a single 37-millimeter cannon or, more commonly, a single 45-millimeter 
            cannon. Through the 1930s, T-26 tanks received armor upgrades.

            In Sep 1939, Russia jointly invaded Poland with Germany during the opening chapter of 
            the European War. At this time, the Russian Army had about 8,500 T-26 light tanks in 
            service, which represented the majority of the entire Russian Army armored force; 
            878 T-26 tanks crossed into Poland from Belorussia and 797 crossed from Ukraine. 
            Only 15 tanks were lost during the Polish campaign, but 302 were put out of commission
            due to mechanical failures.

        <p>
            In Jun 1941, when Germany invaded Russia, the Russian Army had 10,268 T-26 light tanks. 
            By this time, the T-26 design was becoming obsolete in the face of more modern German 
            Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks. By the end of 1941, a great number of T-26 tanks 
            were captured or destroyed. The captured examples were put back into German service 
            in the roles of artillery tractors, self-propelled guns, and infantry support; very 
            few of the captured T-26 tanks were used as front line battle tanks.

            Production of T-26 light tanks ceased in 1941. By that time, 10,300 tanks were built.

           T-34 Model 1941
        </h3>

        <p>
             In 1937, engineer Mikhail Koshkin was tasked to advance Russian armor technology. 
             At this time, the Russian Army tanks were mostly slow T-26 light tanks and BT 
             series of fast tanks; both were lightly armored and unsuitable to modern tank combat. 
             His first prototype, A-20, was a light tank aimed at replacing BT tanks. Not satisfied 
             with the design, he convinced Joseph Stalin to fund a second prototype, A-32, that 
             carried heavier armor and greater caliber weapons. After field tests at Kubinka, 
             Moscow Oblast, Russia, the second prototype proved to be as mobile and versatile 
             as the A-20, making it the winner. The production design, now named T-34, featured 
             heavier armor and wider tracks. The first production prototypes were completed in 
             Jan 1940, and they went through a grueling 2,000-kilometer drive for testing. 
             Even at this point, Russian Army generals were concerned of the high cost of the 
             new design, but the poor performance of Russian armor during the Winter War made 
             sure that plans for the T-34 tanks moved forward. The first production models 
             joined the Russian Army in Sep 1940.

        <p>
            T-34 tanks were effective against German forces in several aspects. Among the intangible 
            characteristics T-34 tanks possessed was the initial shock they gave the German troops. 
            The Germans were brainwashed into believing that the people of the east were technologically 
            inferior, therefore the war would be a simple one given the Germans wield superior weapons. 
            The ease of the Polish conquest only reinforced that notion. Hence, when the German troops 
            encountered the capable T-34 tanks, they were initially in shock. In terms of tangible 
            performance, T-34 tanks shined over the winter terrain. While German tanks had difficulty 
            moving across mud and snow, T-34 tanks with their wider tracks had a much easier time, 
            making T-34 tanks that much more so a deadly weapon. The lack of training for Russian 
            tank commanders and crews, however, limited the tanks' potential.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1946, a final 2,701 units were built by the Russians. Between 1951 and 1956, 
            the design was built under license by Polish and Czechoslovakian firms, where 1,380 
            and 3,185 units were built, respectively. China also produced a number of T-34 tanks 
            under the designation of Type 58. Several non-tank variants were built on the T-34 frame, 
            including flamethrower tanks, self-propelled guns, and bridge layers. After WW2, T-34 tanks 
            served in subsequent conflicts such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Bosnian Civil 
            War in the 1990s.

            SU-76
        </h3>

        <p>
            The first SU-76s appeared in late 1942 and by mid 1943 they were being deployed in appreciable 
            numbers. In order to accommodate the longer hull needed as a self-propelled mounting an a
            dditional road wheel was incorporated on each side, and Independent torsion bars for 
            each road wheel were used for the suspension. The SU-76 was initially powered by a pair of
             70bhp GAZ -202 6-Cylinder inline water-cooled petrol engines, but these proved unreliable 
             in combat and later production models employed 85bhp GAZ-203 engines.

            The gun utilised was the 76.2mm model 1942, 41.5 calibres long, with sixty rounds carried for 
            it. This was mounted in an armoured box on the rear of the hull and had a limited traverse of 
            32 degrees.

            <asp:Image class="img2" ID="SU76" runat="server" ImageUrl="~/images/SU76.jpg"
                ImageAlign="Right" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Mass production began in early 1943 at the 37th and 38th factories of the GAZ Automobile Works 
            at Gorki, and by 1945 over 12,500 SU-76s had been built. As a Wartime expedient, there were 
            few comforts for the four-man crew, who somewhat cruelly nicknamed the vehicle as 'The Bitch'. 
            SU-76 regiments in service would normally comprise a small Headquarters section and three 
            companies of 4-5 SPGs each.
        </p>

        <p>
            The lightly armoured open topped fighting compartment was unfortunately a serious weakness in battle 
            that severely restricted tank hunting operations, and by the end of 1943 the SU-76's gun had already 
            become seriously outranged by more powerful German weapons like those carried by the new Tiger and 
            Panther tanks. As the better SU-85 became available from early 1944 to fill the self-propelled 
            anti-tank role, the SU-76s were turned over to the infantry support role, and by 1945 many SU-76s 
            were retrospectively converted into ammunition carriers or recovery vehicles.
