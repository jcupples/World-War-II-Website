        <h3>
            The Alliance with Germany
        </h3>
        <p>
            The German-Soviet Pact, also known as the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact after the two
            foreign ministers who negotiated the agreement, had two parts. An economic agreement,
            signed on August 19, 1939, provided that Germany would exchange manufactured goods
            for Soviet raw materials. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union also signed a ten-year
            nonaggression pact on August 23, 1939, in which each signatory promised not to attack
            the other.
            </p>
        <p>
            The nonaggression pact of August 23 contained a secret protocol that provided for
            the partition of Poland and the rest of eastern Europe into Soviet and German spheres
            of interest. In accordance with this plan, the Soviet army occupied and annexed
            eastern Poland in the autumn of 1939. With German indulgence, the Soviet Union also
            moved to secure its sphere of interest in eastern Europe in the summer of 1940.

            Hitler Invades Russia
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hitler had always regarded the German-Soviet nonaggression pact as a tactical and
            temporary maneuver. On December 18, 1940, he signed Directive 21 (code-named Operation
            Barbarossa), the first operational order for the invasion of the Soviet Union. From
            the beginning of operational planning, German military and police authorities intended
            to wage a war of annihilation against the Communist state as well as the Jews of
            the Soviet Union, whom they characterized as forming the "racial basis" for the
            Soviet state.</p>
        <p>
            German forces invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, less than two years after
            the German-Soviet Pact was signed.

            Stalingrad and Kursk: Major Turning Points for the Soviets
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the spring of 1942, the German offensive against the Soviet Union was nearly
            a year old. Hitler, believing that he could win in the East by staging a decisive
            offensive in the south aimed at the Soviet Union’s economic resources, launched
            a two-pronged attack on 28 June. Army Group A pushed towards the oil-rich area of
            Baku, and Army Group B advanced towards Stalingrad and the Volga. Stalingrad was
            a key strategic target. It was an important industrial centre, communications hub,
            and sat astride the Volga River. Capturing Stalingrad would cut this waterway –
            the principal supply route from south to central and northern Russia.</p>
        <p>
            The Red Army, demoralised and disheartened by a year of bitter and costly defeats,
            began to employ a new strategy: the fighting retreat. Instead of defending their
            positions at all costs – a strategy which had led to heavy losses during the first
            year of the war – Soviet units were now ordered to withdraw in the face of strong
            German attacks. This tactic would turn the vast expanse of the Russian steppe against
            the Germans, and put huge strain on their supply lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            German troops were taken aback by the fierce street fighting they found themselves
            engaged in during their advance to the city centre. For soldiers accustomed to the
            well-choreographed mobile warfare, ferocious close-quarter fighting in the city’s
            ruins was a new and terrifying experience.</p>
        <p>
            In 19 November 1942, the Soviets used one million men to launch a counterattack,
            Operation Uranus, encircling the city and trapping the German Sixth Army within
            it. For Paulus and his men, the situation was desperate. Winter was setting in,
            and they were running out of food, ammunition and medical supplies. Despite the
            Luftwaffe’s efforts, it was not possible to get enough supplies in by air. In December,
            a relief operation mounted by General von Manstein narrowly failed to break through
            to the city. It was the last hope for the Sixth Army.</p>
        <p>
            On 2 February 1943, General Paulus surrendered with the 91,000 troops that remained.
            The tremendous human cost of the battle is difficult to comprehend. The Axis forces
            (comprised of German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian troops) suffered 800,000 casualties,
            the Soviets more than one million. The battle marked the furthest extent of the
            German advance into the Soviet Union, and is seen by many historians as a key turning
            point in the war.</p>

            Sheer Manpower Wins the War at Great Costs
        </h3>
        <p>
            After the Soviet victory at Stalingrad in February 1943, German generals were convinced
            that a massive offensive on the Eastern Front would still allow them to regain the
            upper hand, and knock Russia out of the war. They planned a two pronged assault
            aimed at ‘pinching off’ the Kursk Salient created by the defeat at Stalingrad. The
            advance was to be launched from the Orel Salient to the north of Kursk and from
            Belgorod to the south. Both ‘prongs’ would surround Kursk, restoring the lines of
            Army Group South to their winter 1941-1942 position.</p>
        <p>
            Throughout the remainder of 1943, the Soviets continued pushing the Germans back.
            In August 1943, they retook Orel; in the south, fierce battles throughout July and
            August culminated in the recapture of Kharkov. In the centre, Soviet troops took
            Bryansk, Smolensk and Gomel. In the south, the Germans' retreat to the River Dneiper
            forced them to abandon captured farmland and industrial resources. The Germans found
            it impossible to hold this line, which was broken in October. Kiev, the Ukrainian
            capital and the USSR’s third largest city, was retaken the following month.</p>
        <p>
            1944 began as 1943 had ended: with unstoppable Soviet success. At the end of January,
            the 900 day siege of Leningrad was lifted; almost a million of the northern city’s
            inhabitants had perished. In the south, southern Ukraine and Galitzia were captured
            in March. The Germans were forced to evacuate the hard-won Crimean Peninsula. April
            and May saw the liberation of Odessa and Sevastapol. On 9 June, Operation Bagration
            was launched to retake Belarus. 166 Soviet divisions and 2,700 Soviet tanks crushed
            the 38 German divisions of Army Group Centre, taking Minsk on 2 July.</p>
        <p>
            The Soviet troops now broke through on the Balkan Front and advanced towards Vistula.
            With the Soviet homeland secure, Stalin announced that the Red Army had begun a
            ‘march of liberation’. Sadly, this ‘liberation’ did not extend to Poland. On 5 August,
            the Polish Home Army, encouraged by the Soviet advance, rose against the Nazis in
            Warsaw. In an act which did unspeakable damage to Allied relations, Stalin offered
            no military or material assistance to the Poles. He also denied permission for Allied
            aircraft carrying aid to land in Soviet airfields. Stalin cynically calculated that
            it was in his interest to see Polish patriots destroyed by the Nazis, as they would
            stand in the way of his post-war plans for Poland. On 5 October, General Komorowski’s
            Army surrendered. The Nazis levelled Warsaw in reprisal and 300,000 Poles – including
            many innocent civilians – were slaughtered. The Soviets would finally enter Warsaw
            in January 1945, after its abandonment by the Germans.</p>
