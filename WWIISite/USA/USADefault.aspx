            The Pearl Harbor Attack: The US Forced Into War
        </h3>
        <p>
            When war broke out in Europe, US President Franklin Roosevelt recognised that the
            conflict threatened US security, and looked for ways to help the European democracies
            without direct involvement in the war. This necessity increased in June 1940, when
            the Fall of France left Britain as the only democracy standing between Nazi Germany
            and America. In 1939, the Fourth Neutrality Act authorised the US to trade arms
            with belligerents provided that the countries paid in cash and collected them. In
            March 1941, Roosevelt moved further towards making the US the ‘arsenal of democracy’
            with the Lend-Lease Act, which permitted the lending, leasing, selling, or bartering
            of arms, ammunition and food to “any country whose defence the President deems vital
            to the defence of the US.”</p>
        <p>
            The US was sucked further towards the conflict when its navy and air force began
            to ‘escort’ British convoys which transported Lend-Lease material across the Atlantic,
            protecting them from German submarines. Roosevelt’s announcement of a ‘shoot on
            sight’ policy in September 1941 following an attack on the USS Greer enraged isolationist
            senators; they alleged that Roosevelt was deliberately provoking skirmishes with
            the Germans. Meanwhile, Churchill repeatedly attempted to convince Roosevelt to
            enter the war. At the August 1941 Atlantic Conference, the two leaders composed
            a charter for the post-war world; Roosevelt tackled the thorny issue of the British
            Empire, promoting the recognition of “the right of all peoples to choose the government
            under which they will live.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Churchill did not have to wait long. After the bombing of the US Pacific fleet at
            Pearl Harbor in December 1941, only one congressman opposed the declaration of war;
            the vote in the senate was unanimous. Hitler’s declaration of war on the US, which
            came four days later, was actually a blessing in disguise for Roosevelt; it enabled
            him to legitimately pursue a ‘Germany first’ strategy. In November 1942, Operation
            Torch, the invasion of North Africa, became the first US military offensive of the
            war in the West. Allied troops slowly cornered German forces in North Africa, who
            surrendered in Tunisia in May 1943. The joint British-US victory, costly and hard
            fought as it was, was invaluable in mobilising US public opinion behind the war
            effort.</p>

            D-Day: Operation
        </h3>
        <p>
            On 6 June 1944, just after midnight, the Allied assault upon Hitler’s ‘Fortress
            Europe’ began. The operation caught the German military high command unaware. Low
            tides and bad weather – combined with Allied deception plans – had convinced the
            Germans that an attack was unlikely at that time. As more than 1,000 British bombers
            began to pummel Normandy’s coastal defences, Rommel, commanding German defences
            in France, was in Germany celebrating his wife’s birthday.</p>
        <p>
            Early Allied success was aided by the confused German reaction. The first confirmation
            of a large-scale attack did not arrive until 2:15 am; that an invasion was in progress
            was not confirmed until 4:15. It was only at 6 am, when Normandy’s defenders saw
            the horizon obscured by an unbroken line of Allied ships, that all doubt was removed.
            Along nearly 100 kilometres of coast, Allied warships and aircraft pounded German
            defences. At 6:30, US soldiers went ashore by landing craft at Utah and Omaha beaches.
            An hour later, the British and Canadians arrived at the beaches of Gold, Juno and
            Sword. Fortuitously, troops at Utah accidently landed two kilometres from their
            target, on a virtually unguarded beach. The landing zone was quickly secured with
            few losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Omaha Beach, where aerial bombardment had done little to dent German defences,
            the Americans met fierce resistance. From cliff-top bunkers, the defenders pummelled
            US troops with machine gun fire and shells as soon as landing craft ramps were lowered.
            Those who made it ashore found it impossible to advance across 200 metres of open
            beach. Amphibious tanks intended to cover the infantry’s advance had sunk in the
            rough seas. The news from Omaha was so bad that the landings there were almost called
            off, but eventually small groups of American infantry worked their way around the
            German defences, outflanked and stormed them, allowing the beachhead to be secured.
            But Omaha cost the Americans more than 2,000 casualties.</p>
        <p>
            When British and Canadian troops landed at 7.30, supported by tanks, the tide was
            high, leaving fewer metres of beach to traverse. Although mines sunk a number of
            boats, soldiers succeeded in silencing German machine guns within half an hour.
            At the day’s end, although they had not yet taken their objective of Caen, the soldiers
            had penetrated six kilometres inland, and their foothold in Normandy was secure.
            At 6pm, when Churchill addressed the House of Commons, it was to announce the astounding
            success of an operation which would go down in military legend.</p>

            Japan Refuses to Back Down
        </h3>
        <p>
            Since 1942, more than 100,000 scientists of the Manhattan Project had been working
            on the bomb’s development. At the time, it was the largest collective scientific
            effort ever undertaken. It involved 37 installations across the US, 13 university
            laboratories and a host of prestigious participants such as the Nobel prizewinning
            physicists Arthur Holly Compton and Harold Urey. Directed by the Army's chief engineer,
            Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the Manhattan Project was also the most secret
            wartime project in history. At first, scientists worked in isolation in different
            parts of the US, unaware of the magnitude of the project in which they were involved.
            Later, the project was centralised and moved to an isolated laboratory headed by
            physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in Los Alamos, New Mexico. On 16 July 1945, scientists
            carried out the first trial of the bomb in the New Mexico desert. President Truman
            received news of the successful test whilst negotiating the post-war settlement
            in Europe at the Potsdam Conference.</p>
        <p>
            As questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the US Air
            Force and Navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional
            bombing and submarine war against Japan would have soon forced her to surrender.
            Joseph Grew, America’s last ambassador to Japan before the war started, also publicly
            alleged that the Truman administration knew about (and ignored) Japanese attempts
            to open surrender negotiations with the US using the USSR as a mediator. At this
            time, another interpretation - most famously espoused in 1965 by political economist
            Gar Alperovitz in his book Atomic Diplomacy - emerged: the atomic bombing of Japan
            had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the US’s military might to the Soviet
            Union, about whom the Americans were increasingly nervous.
        </p>
        <p>
            The moral aspect of the attacks upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki continues to divide
            historians. While some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the Japanese
            population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the
            context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been
            used to end the war as quickly as possible.</p>
