            M4A1 Sherman
        </h3>
        <p>
            On 31 Aug 1940, the United States Army Ordnance Department submitted the M4 tank design
            as a potential replacement for the existing M3 tanks. It was approved on 18 Apr 1941 
            as the prototype promised a tank that was as capable as the successful German tanks. 
            The first model was completed on 2 Sep 1941, and the design entered full production 
            in Feb 1942, three months after the United States entered WW2.

        <p>
            While Americans developed more lethal rounds to improve the M4 Sherman tanks, 
            the British took a different approach. Royal Tank Regiment Major George Brighty 
            led an effort to modify certain batches of M4 Sherman tanks, particularly the M4 
            and M4A4 variants, so that they would carry the larger caliber 17-pounder guns. 
            The end result were the Sherman Firefly tanks, which effectively became the most 
            powerfully gunned Allied tanks of World War II, capable of dueling the feared 
            German Panther and Tiger tanks. Sherman Firefly tanks were first used by British 
            and Commonwealth units on 6 Jun 1944 at the Normandy landings, and were used until 
            the end of the European War.

            Notable weaknesses of the M4 Sherman tanks include the ease for earlier variants to 
            catch fire when struck by enemy armor piercing rounds. Despite this negative characteristic, 
            the majority of Sherman tank losses were not attributed to duels with enemy vehicles; 
            rather, they were more often lost to mines, aircraft, and infantry anti-tank weapons. 
            They were also known for their difficulty when traversing across soft terrain, such as 
            snow or mud, due to the narrow width. To remedy this weakness, Soviet tank crews
            modified the tracks for better grip.

            After the war, the US Army continued to employ Sherman tanks of the M4A3E8 variant, 
            equipped with either 76-millimeter guns or 105-millimeter howitzers. They saw action 
            in the Korean War despite new tank models had already entered service. During the M4 
            Sherman design's production life, over 50,000 units were built.

           M10 Wolverine
        </h3>

        <p>
             The German Army doctrine of concentrating tanks to rapidly penetrate enemy defensive 
             lines led to the US Army's request for a new weapon dedicated to counter such offensives. 
             In Jun 1942, prototype tank destroyer T35E1 was finalized into the 3-inch Gun Motor Carriage 
             M10 and was ordered into full production. A variant design was developed for British use, 
             which was designated as 3 inch Self Propelled Wolverine by the British Army. They were built 
             upon the M4 Sherman medium tank chassis and had open-topped turrets, and the 3-inch M7 guns 
             were rated to penetrate 3 inches of armor at the distance of 1,000 yards at 30 degrees from 
             vertical. Some of the British Wolverine vehicles were later upgraded with Ordnance QF 17 
             pounder Mark V guns, which improved armor penetration capabilities.

        </p>

        <p>
            M10 tank destroyers first saw action in 1943 in Tunisia, where their guns could penetrate the 
            armor of any Axis armored vehicle in North Africa. It was not until the Normandy campaign in 
            mid-1944 when they began encountering tanks, namely Tiger and Panther tanks, which were immune 
            to the 3-inch and 17-pounder guns. Additionally, by this time the US Army generals were 
            beginning to see that the massed tank assaults that they studied in 1940 which led to the 
            M10 design no longer took place with significant frequency, thus concentrating numbers of 
            M10 tank destroyers in the rear to counter possible enemy tank assaults was actually not effective. 
            Thus, some M10 tank destroyers began to be assigned to front line infantry units for use as infantry 
            support guns, sometimes fighting alongside their successors 90mm Gun Motor Carriage M36. A number of 
            them were also used in the Pacific War where crews reported that the open-top design made them 
            vulnerable to tactics employed by Japanese troops, which brought the enemy much closer to the 
            vehicles. Another complaint, made by M10 crews in all theaters, was that the unpowered turrets 
            required hand cranks to turn, which was very slow especially in combat conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            About 54 M10 tank destroyers made their way to the Soviet Union during the war, while a few of 
            them were also used by the Free French. After the war in 1949, 17 M10 tank destroyers without 
            working guns, with thicker armor, and each with an additional bow gun port were sold to the 
            Republic of China; the Chinese troops equipped them with captured Japanese 150-millimeter 
            infantry howitzers just prior to withdrawing to Taiwan.

            M18 Hellcat
        </h3>

        <p>
             December 1941, the Ordnance Corps issued a requirement for the design of a fast tank destroyer 
             using a Torsion bar suspension, the Wright/Continental R-975 engine, and a 37 mm gun.

            The M18 originated in the design studio of Harley Earl from the Buick motor company division of 
            General Motors, whose team also worked extensively on early camouflage paint. Even the Hellcat 
            logo on the M18’s front corner and patches worn by its crew was designed by Earl’s staff. 
            Flanked by the words “Seek, Strike, Destroy,” it depicts a wildcat biting down on crushed treads, 
            the Hellcat’s mission of targeting enemy tanks.

            Buick engineers developed an innovative torsion bar suspension that provided a steady ride. 
            Though it weighed about 20 tons, the Hellcat was capable of traveling upwards of 60 mph. 
            Its power came from a nine-cylinder, 450-horsepower radial-type aircraft engine paired 
            with a three-speed Hydramatic transmission.

            Once developed, the Hellcat was tested in the same manner as passenger cars before and after it, 
            at the General Motors Milford Proving Ground. Top speed testing was done on a paved, banked oval 
            and ride quality tests were done over specially developed stretches of bumps. The M18 also required 
            additional tests of its ability to ford six feet of water, climb small walls, and ram through structures.

            Production of the M18 Hellcat began in mid-1943 and ended in October 1944. 
            The project was so secretive that a story about the “new” tank destroyer ran in 
            newspapers just a month before production.

        <p>
            On September 19, 1944, in the Nancy Bridgehead near Arracourt, France, the 704th Tank Destroyer 
            Battalion was attached to the 4th Armored Division. Lt. Edwin Leiper led one M18 platoon of C 
            Company to Rechicourt-la-Petite, on the way to Moncourt. He saw a German tank gun muzzle 
            appearing out of the fog 30 feet away, and deployed his platoon. In a five-minute period, 
            five German tanks of the 113 Panzer Brigade were knocked out for the loss of one M18. The 
            platoon continued to fire and destroyed ten more German tanks while losing another two M18s. 
            One of the platoon's M18s commanded by Sgt Henry R. Hartman knocked out six of the German tanks, 
            most of which were the much-feared Panthers.

            The M18 Hellcat was a key element during World War II in the Battle of the Bulge. On December 19–20, 
            the 1st Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment was ordered to support Team Desobry, 
            a battalion-sized tank-infantry task force of the 10th Armored Division assigned to defend Noville
            located north-northeast of both Foy and of Bastogne just 4.36 miles away. With just four M18 
            tank destroyers of the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion to assist, the paratroopers attacked units of 
            the 2nd Panzer Division, whose mission was to proceed by secondary roads via Monaville to seize a 
            key highway and capture, among other objectives, fuel dumps—for the lack of which the overall 
            German counter-offensive faltered and failed. Worried about the threat to its left flank in 
            Bastogne, it organized a major joint arms attack to seize Noville. Team Desobry's high 
            speed highway journey to reach the blocking position is one of the few documented cases 
            wherein the top speed of the M18 Hellcat - 55 miles per hour - was actually used to get 
            ahead of an enemy force.
        </p>

        <p>
            The M18 continued in production until October 1944, when the war was nearing its end. 2,507 
            had been produced by that time, at a unit cost of $57,500. Though all tank destroyer units 
            were disbanded by the U.S. after the war, surplus M18s continued to see limited service.
