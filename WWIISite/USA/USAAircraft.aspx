            P-39Q Airacobra
        </h3>
        <p>
            In Feb 1937, United States Army Air Corps Lieutenant Benjamin Kelsey issued a request 
            for a new heavily armed, high performance, high altitude, single seat fighter. The 
            manufacturer Bell took a new approach to fulfill this request. Instead of the usual 
            manner of designing an aircraft around a suitable engine, Bell engineers designed 
            this aircraft around its heavy weapons. This resulted in the engine being located 
            in the center of the aircraft just behind the cockpit which drove the propellers 
            through a shaft 10 feet in length that ran in the cockpit floor. This configuration 
            freed up the nose to house the heavy weapons that the Army had called for, which 
            included a 37-millimeter T9 cannon. Because of this design, space for fuel storage 
            was limited, thus this aircraft was to serve in short range missions only.

        <p>
            In Sep 1940, the British Royal Air Force ordered 386 P-39D Airacobra fighters. 
            The order number would later increase to 675. The first fighter arrived to the 
            No. 601 Squadron RAF on 6 Aug 1941. The British pilots found the performance 
            inadequate, especially at high altitudes. This was caused by the lack of 
            turbo-superchargers, something equipped in the prototype but was removed 
            from the design right before the design entered production. Also, the prototype 
            lacked the heavy armor that was equipped in production models. In Mar 1942, 
            the squadron was re-equipped with Spitfire fighters. Ultimately, the RAF only 
            retained 80 P-39 fighters for its own use, transferring the other 200 that it 
            had received to the Soviet Union.
        </p>

        <p>
            A total of 4,924 P-39 fighters were allocated to the Soviet Union, of which 
            4,758 safely made it to their destinations. Soviet Air Force pilots discovered 
            a problem with P-39 Airacobra fighters in which the aircraft could enter 
            dangerous flat spins when the aircraft was improperly loaded, i.e. not enough
            weight in the front of the aircraft. Bell did not have a solution for this 
            problem other than stressing the importance of proper weight distribution. 
            Despite of this issue, Soviet pilots appreciated these fighters for their 
            air-to-air combat capabilities, particularly regarding the 37-millimeter 
            T9 cannons that could inflict heavy damage to enemy aircraft with only a 
            few shots. While British and American pilots complained of the inadequacies 
            in high altitudes, Soviet pilots found this characteristic to be of little 
            concern, as the war in Eastern Europe required fewer high altitude operations.
            Production for P-39 Airacobra fighters ended in Aug 1944. By this time, 
            9,558 aircraft were built, about half of which, 4,773, were sent to the Soviet 
            Union.

           P-51D Mustang
        </h3>

        <p>
             In late 1939, with the likelihood of full scale war in Europe a major concern, the 
             British Royal Air Force was looking seriously at methods of quickly increasing its 
             fighter strength. In April 1940, the British Air Purchasing Commission approached 
             North American Aviation with the intent of having them build Curtiss P-40's for the 
             RAF. Since the P-40 design went back to 1933, James H. "Dutch" Kendelberger, the 
             president of North American offered to build an entirely new advanced fighter using 
             the same Allison V-1710-39 engine used on the P-40. The British agreed on the new type, 
             NA-73X, only on the stipulation that a prototype be 
             on hand within 120 days. A prototype was finished in 117 days minus the engine. Wheels had 
             to be borrowed from an AT-6 trainer. Six weeks later after several modifications, 
             the aircraft took to the air October 26,1940. With Vance Breese at the controls, 
             who was one of the most famous test pilots in his day, the XP-51 reached 382 mph, 
             exceeding the P-40's top speed by 25 mph. The P-51 was an immediate success and it 
             even outperformed the Spitfire.

        </p>

        <p>
              The P-51D with the dorsal fin represented the most typical Mustang configuration. 
              The wingspan was 37 feet with an area of 233 square feet and was 32 feet 3 inches long. 
              Height was 13 feet 8 inches. The Packard-built Merlin V-1650-7 was capable of delivering 
              1,695 hp which provided a speed of 437 mph at 25,000 feet. Weights were 7,125 lbs. empty 
              and 10,100 lbs. normal gross, but an additional 2,000 lbs. could be carried. Internal fuel
              capacity was 105 gallons, giving a range of 950 miles at 362 miles per hour at 25,000 feet. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To say P-51 Mustangs were successful would be an understatement. It is considered to be the
            best piston aircraft of World War II and became one of the world's aviation elite. A total of 
            14,819 Mustangs of all types were built for the USAAF. American Mustangs destroyed 4,950 enemy 
            aircraft making them the highest scoring US fighter in the Europe Theater of Operations. They
            were used as dive-bombers, bomber escorts, ground-attackers, interceptors, for photo-recon missions, 
            trainers, transports (with a jump-seat), and after the war, high performance racers.

        <h3>
            B-25J Mitchell
        </h3>

        <p>
            The original design for the B-25 Mitchell medium bombers was drafted with 
            Britain and France as the intended customers, but they opted for A-20 Havoc 
            bombers from Douglas Aircraft Company instead. In 1939, the United States 
            Army Air Corps evaluated the design and was satisfied with the prototype 
            aircraft's performance. The original prototype, code named NA-40B, crashed 
            on 11 Apr 1939, but the US Army liked the little they had observed thus far, 
            and decided to order the design into production without further testing. 
            Out of the modified design, now named NA-62, the production B-25 Mitchell 
            bombers were born. Some of the changes with NA-62 include a new wing shape 
            and a larger tail fin. The first B-25 bombers entered service with the US 
            Army in 1940.

        </p>

        <p>
            In the Pacific War, B-25 Mitchell bombers were frequently used at low altitude, 
            acting as ground attack aircraft instead of as medium bombers. These strafing 
            aircraft were first devised in the field by the likes of Major Paul Irving "Pappy" 
            Gunn, who initially modified A-20 Havoc bombers but later also submitted requests 
            to perform similar modifications to B-25 bombers by adding guns and eliminating any 
            unnecessary weight and space; as his request was approved by George Kenney, Kenney
            would also claim design credit, noting that he had further contributed to Gunn's 
            designs. The resulting B-25G aircraft each had additional machine guns and a 75mm 
            M4 cannon, the largest caliber weapon ever equipped in an American bomber. A later 
            variant, B-25J, increased the number of machine guns to 18. Finally, B-25 bombers 
            sometimes served as troop transports in the South Pacific.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although B-25 bombers were noisy and caused hearing problems for the pilots and 
            crew after the war, they were were well loved by their crew for that they could 
            absorb significant amounts of damage and still maintain manageable flight characteristics.

            9,984 were built between 1941 and 1945; 6,608 of them were built at North American's
            Fairfax Airport plant in Kansas City, Kansas, United States.
