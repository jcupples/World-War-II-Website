            The Great War

        <h3>
               The Bloodiest War in History
        </h3>
        <p>
            World War 2, also known as the Second World War, was a war fought from 1939 to 1945 in Europe and, 
            during much of the 1930s and 1940s, in Asia.

            The war in Europe began in earnest on September 1, 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, 
            and concluded on September 2, 1945, with the official surrender of the last Axis nation, Japan. 
            However, in Asia the war began earlier with Japanese interventions in China, and in Europe, 
            the war ended earlier with the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945.

            The conflict spilled over into Africa, included a handful of incidents
             in the Americas, and a series of major naval battles.

            It was the largest armed conflict in history, spanning the entire world and involving 
            more countries than any other war, as well as introducing powerful new weapons, 
            culminating in the first use of nuclear weapons.

            However, despite the name, not all countries of the world were involved; some through 
            neutrality, others through strategic insignificance .

            The war ravaged civilians more severely than any previous conflict and served as a 
            backdrop for genocidal killings by Nazi Germany as well as several other mass slaughters 
            of civilians which, although not technically genocide, were significant.

            These included the massacre of millions of Chinese and Korean nationals by Japan, 
            internal mass killings in the Soviet Union, and the bombing of civilian targets 
            in German and Japanese cities by the Allies. In total, World War II produced about 
            50 million deaths, more than any other war to date.

        Technological Warfare

    <h3>
        Tanks, Planes and Weapons, Oh My!
    </h3>

    <p>
        LIn the Western European Theatre of World War II, air power became crucial throughout the war, 
        both in tactical and strategic operations (respectively, battlefield and long-range). Superior 
        German aircraft, aided by ongoing introduction of design and technology innovations, allowed the 
        erman armies to overrun Western Europe with great speed in 1940, largely assisted by lack of 
        Allied aircraft, which in any case lagged in design and technical development during the slump 
        in research investment after the Great Depression. Since the end of World War I, the French Air 
        Force had been badly neglected, as military leaders preferred to spend money on ground armies and 
        static fortifications to fight another World War I-style war. As a result, by 1940, the French Air 
        Force had only 1562 planes and was together with 1070 RAF planes facing 5,638 Luftwaffe fighters and 
        fighter-bombers. Most French airfields were located in north-east France, and were quickly overrun 
        in the early stages of the campaign. The Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom possessed some very 
        advanced fighter planes, such as Spitfires and Hurricanes, but these were not useful for attacking 
        ground troops on a battlefield, and the small number of planes dispatched to France with the British 
        Expeditionary Force were destroyed fairly quickly. Subsequently, the Luftwaffe was able to achieve air 
        superiority over France in 1940, giving the German military an immense advantage in terms of reconnaissance 
        and intelligence.

        The Treaty of Versailles had imposed severe restrictions upon Germany constructing vehicles for military
         purposes, and so throughout the 1920s and 1930s, German arms manufacturers and the Wehrmacht had begun 
         secretly developing tanks. As these vehicles were produced in secret, their technical specifications 
          battlefield potentials were largely unknown to the European Allies until the war actually began. When 
          German troops invaded the Benelux nations and France in May 1940, German weapons technology proved to 
          be immeasurably superior to that of the Allies.
