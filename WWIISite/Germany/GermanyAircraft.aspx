            BF-109F</h3>
        <p>
            The Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters were designed by Willy Messerschmitt in the early 1930s. 
            After the original manufacturer Bayerische Flugzeugwerk was renamed to Messerschmitt AG, 
            later productions of these fighters carried the designation Me 109, though this designation 
            was used in only few official Luftwaffe documents. The British also referred to them as Bf 109; 
            "By 1945, we were drowning in Bf 109 nameplates", said British aviation expert Bill Gunston, 
            referring to the nameplates of numerous Bf 109 fighters shot down over Britain, 
            "[t]here's no excuse for not referring to the aircraft by its right name". The Americans, 
            however, aircraft of this model were known as Me 109 since the start; "It will always be 
            the Me 109 to me", said retired United States Air Force Colonel James L. McWhorter, who 
            fought against them as a pilot of the US Army Air Force 365th Fighter Group during WW2 
            from the Normandy Campaign until the end of the European War.

            The Bf 109 design had weight-savings in mind. All structural points including landing gears 
            were mounted to a single firewall to the front of the cockpit. Their powerful DB 601A engines 
            gave them good speed, but more importantly, they were fuel-injected, thus they could continue 
            running even during steep dives which would starve a traditional carburetor engine of gasoline. 
            This characteristic would lead to the tactic of going into sudden dives when being chased by 
            British fighters; should the British pursuers continue the chase by performing a similar dive, 
            as the steep dive produced negative gravitational force, British fighters' engines might cut out 
            momentarily, thus the Bf 109 fighters would gain a brief advantage to get out of the chase.

            Compliments came from the United States as well. In the summer of 1938, United States Marine Corps 
            pilot Major Al Williams, a friend of Udet's, test flew a Bf 109D fighter and claimed that it was 
            superior to any fighter design that the United States had to offer at that time. Famed aviator 
            Charles Lindbergh, who had a chance to fly the German fighter in Oct 1938, was very impressed.

        <p>
            Bf 109 fighters fought over nearly every battlefield involving German forces. They were instrumental 
            in the establishment of German air superiority in Yugoslavia, Greece, and the early phases of the 
            invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1942, they began to be replaced by the newer Fw 190 fighters, 
            though they remained in production through the end of the war. The longevity of the design and the 
            capability of the fighters led them to become the largest production fighter design in history at 
            over 33,000 units built.

        <h3>
            FW 190 A-8
        </h3>

        <p>
             The prototype Fw 190 Würger ("Shrike") aircraft flew on 1 Jun 1939. The maneuverable and speedy 
             aircraft very quickly made a good impression on the Luftwaffe officers, and by late 1940 they were 
             seen on the front lines, though they did not serve in combat roles until Aug 1941. It immediately outclassed 
             the Spitfire V, which appeared sluggish and outdated by comparison. From that time on, in spite of 
             some severe problems with the BMW 801 engine, the 190 kept even or ahead of Allied fighters through 
             successive versions. The BMW 801 engine tended to overheat, but this fault was rectified by 
             improvements to the cooling fan and, in general, the Fw 190A was highly praised by the test pilots. 
             They particularly favored the wide-track undercarriage which tremendously improved ground stability 
             as compared with the Bf 109. One of the unusual features of the fighter commented on by test pilots 
             was the fact that, at high altitude and high speed, the BMW 801 engine produced a pair of contrails 
             which started immediately behind the exhaust exits and completely hid the wings.

        </p>

        <p>
            The Focke-Wulf was not only faster but its superior handling and faster roll rate gave it an edge in 
            the hands of even less experienced pilots. Such sparkling performance combined with the 190's superior 
            armament presented Allied pilots with a real challenge until German pilot training began to drop in quality. 
            The standard Fw 190A was quickly modified to perform a number of roles, particularly that of fighter-bomber 
            in the F and G versions. These deleted the outer 20 mm cannon in favor of various combinations of bomb racks 
            or cannon pods for the MK 103 30 mm cannon. Later versions of the FW 190A featured up to six 20 mm cannon;
            the A-6/R-6 had two 210 mm unguided rockets with which to attack US heavy bombers. 
            The wide track landing gear assured ease of handling on takeoff and landing, unlike the twitchy Messerschmitt 109. 
            The 190 was also one of the first fighters to feature a clear rear canopy, allowing pilots to keep an excellent 
            lookout for enemy fighters. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In honor of designer Kurt Tank, the Fw 190's designation was changed to Tank or Ta 152. 
            This beautiful inline-engined fighter was to be the ultimate version of the famous fighter 
            but delays resulted in the stopgap Fw 190D, in itself an outstanding aircraft. In the 
            chaotic final year of the Third Reich, the D ended up being the major inline engine 
            version with only a few Ta 152Hs, and possibly a few Ta 152Cs, getting into combat. 
            By the end of the war, more than 20,000 Fw 190s had been built; about one-third as fighter bombers.

        <h3>
            Junkers Ju-87D Stuka
        </h3>

        <p>
            The all-metal Ju 87 Stuka aircraft were the German Luftwaffe's primary dive bombers. 
            At first glance, they were crude-looking, but this feature reflected the principle 
            behind the Ju 87 design, which stressed the ease of production and the ruggedness of 
            the aircraft over other items on the wish list. Two unique characteristics made these 
            aircraft stand out: first, the dive brakes, automatic pull-up systems, and the 
            strengthened airframes ensured that the bomber maintained control during dives; 
            then, the wind-powered sirens terrorized the enemy psychologically. "The Stuka was 
            more than a bomber", said William Manchester, "it was also an instrument of fear." 
            The enemy soldiers who stood opposite these bombers, morale melting away by the noise 
            of the sirens, ran in fear as they believed the bombs were coming straight for them.

        </p>

        <p>
            While they were among the key components of the successful Blitzkrieg campaign 
            on continental Europe early in the war, they were not so effective during the 
            Battle of Britain. They were excellent weapons against shipping in the English 
            Channel and ground targets in Britain, but the lack of air superiority meant 
            that their extremely slow speed made them easy targets for British fighters. 
            The original variant of the design, A-1, had a top speed of under 200 miles 
            per hour; nevertheless, the slow speed was not considered an issue as they 
            were dive bombers and not fighters. This design philosophy was also a reason 
            why the original variant did not employ forward-firing armament, though this 
            was changed in later variants. This weakness also hurt other aircraft in the 
            German Luftwaffe arsenal, as escorting Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters had to fly 
            in zig-zag in order to maintain formation with Ju 87 Stuka aircraft, which 
            led to a higher fuel consumption rate and making the fighters more vulnerable 
            to being bounced by British fighters
        </p>

        <p>
            Because Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers performed so well as tactical bombers, 
            this success became a curse as well. Ernst Udet, in charge of the technical 
            department of the Luftwaffe, was so convinced in the capability of dive bombers 
            that he requested all German bombers to be designed with dive bombing capability; 
            this effectively removed any chance Germany had to develop an effective long-range 
            bomber even if such an item made its way on the wish list of the Luftwaffe.
