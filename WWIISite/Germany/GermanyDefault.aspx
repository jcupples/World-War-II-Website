        <h3>
            The First Act of War
        </h3>
        <p>
            On 1 September 1939, 62 German divisions supported by 1,300 aircraft began the invasion
            of Poland. At 8pm on the same day, Poland requested military assistance from Britain
            and France. Two days later, in fulfilment of their April 1939 pledge to support
            the country in the event of an attack, Britain and France declared war on Germany.
            World War II had begun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poland had been overrun in four weeks, long before any meaningful Anglo-French military
            aid could reach Poland, and proving Hitler’s conviction that Polish armed forces
            would be no match for the Blitzkrieg unleashed by Germany. The Soviet Union – which
            had spent the 1930s searching for a ‘collective security’ agreement in Europe and
            had signed a non-aggression pact with Germany on 28 August 1939 – also profited
            from the invasion. On 17 September the Red Army crossed the Polish border in the
            east, seizing a third of all Polish territory. Some Poles fled across the border
            into Romania, eventually reaching the west and continuing the war as the Free Polish
            Forces.</p>

        <h3>
            The Occupation of Paris
        </h3>
        <p>
            By May 1940, Europe had been at war for nine months. Yet Britain and France, despite
            having declared war on Germany in September 1939 following Hitler’s attack on Poland,
            had seen little real fighting. This tense period of anticipation – which came to
            be known as the ‘Phoney War’ – met an abrupt end on 10 May 1940, when Germany launched
            an invasion of France and the Low Countries. The German plan of attack, codenamed
            Case Yellow, entailed an armoured offensive through the Ardennes Forest, which bypassed
            the strong French frontier defences of the Maginot Line. The advance would then
            threaten to encircle French and British divisions to the north, stationed on the
            Belgian frontier.</p>
        <p>
            On 5 June, the Germans swung southwards and French resistance finally collapsed,
            although not without heavy fighting. On 10 June, Italy opportunistically entered
            the war on Germany’s side. Four days later, the French capital fell, provoking the
            flight of the French Government to Bordeaux. The Government capitulated on 25 June,
            just seven weeks after the beginning of the invasion.

        <h3>
            Betrayal: Hitler's Biggest Mistake
        </h3>
        <p>
            On 22 June 1941 Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Codenamed Operation Barbarossa,
            it was the largest military operation in history, involving more than 3 million
            Axis troops and 3,500 tanks. It was the logical culmination of Hitler’s belief that
            the German ‘master race’ should seek ‘lebensraum’ (living space) in the east, at
            the expense of the ‘subhuman’ native Slav people, who were to be exterminated or
            reduced to serf status. Planning for Barbarossa had begun over a year previously,
            in the wake of Germany’s stunning success against the western allies in France.
            The triumphalism that followed this victory, combined with widely believed reports
            that the Soviet armed forces were weak and deficient (evidence came from defeats
            by Finland in 1939) led to great optimism in the German high command, with Hitler
            declaring, ‘we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will
            come crashing down.’</p>
        <p>
            Initially all went well for the Germans, some units advancing 50 miles on the first
            day, although resistance was fiercer than expected in the south. With Stalin personally
            intervening to forbid generals to retreat, large Soviet forces were encircled and
            destroyed or taken prisoner. 250,000 were lost in a massive encirclement around
            Minsk at the end of June, 180,000 were taken prisoner at Smolensk, while the Red
            Army suffered 500,000 casualties at the Battle of Kiev in September.
        </p>
        <p>
            But despite the enormous casualties they had inflicted, the Germans had failed to
            land a decisive blow. They had underestimated both the resources of the Soviet Union
            and its willingness to accept massive losses. Now the German offensives were running
            out of steam, as front-line units halted for resupply and replacements. At a crucial
            phase of the operation, Hitler insisted that the panzer divisions of Army Group
            Centre, which were advancing on Moscow, were diverted to overcome resistance in
            the north and south. With this achieved, the drive on Moscow resumed on 2 October,
            codenamed Operation Typhoon. Ten days later German units were within 90 miles of
            the Russian capital, but stubborn Soviet resistance and heavy German casualties,
            combined with heavy rain which turned bad roads into rivers of mud, slowed the advance
            to a crawl. By the beginning of December, German troops were within sight of the
            spires of Moscow. However, a massive Soviet counterattack, using fresh units brought
            in from the East, supported by T-34 tanks, drove the Germans back. As the Russian
            winter set in, German offensive operations were abandoned.

        <h3>
            Hitler's Death and the Fall of the Third Reich
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker
            in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle
            for Berlin would be the final battle of the war.Some 325,000 soldiers of Germany's
            Army Group B were surrounded and captured on 18 April, leaving the path open for
            American forces to reach Berlin. By 11 April the Americans crossed the Elbe, 100
            kilometres to the west of the city. Meanwhile, on 16 April, Soviet forces to the
            east crossed the Oder and commenced the battle for the Seelow Heights, the last
            major defensive line protecting Berlin on that side. By 19 April the Germans were
            in full retreat from Seelow Heights, leaving no front line. Berlin was bombarded
            by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April. By the evening of 21 April,
            Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city.</p>
        <p>
            Late in the morning of 30 April, with the Soviets less than 500 metres from the
            bunker, Hitler had a meeting with General Helmuth Weidling, commander of the Berlin
            Defence Area, who told him that the garrison would probably run out of ammunition
            that night and that the fighting in Berlin would inevitably come to an end within
            the next 24 hours. Weidling asked Hitler for permission for a breakout, a request
            he had made unsuccessfully before. Hitler did not answer, and Weidling went back
            to his headquarters in the Bendlerblock. At about 13:00 he received Hitler's permission
            to try a breakout that night. Hitler, two secretaries, and his personal cook then
            had lunch, after which Hitler and Braun s aid their personal farewells to members
            of the Führerbunker staff and fellow occupants. At around 14:30 Adolf and Eva Hitler
            went into Hitler's personal study. Adolf Hitler committed suicide by gunshot on
            30 April 1945 around 3:30pm in his Führerbunker in Berlin. His wife Eva committed
            suicide with him by ingesting cyanide. That afternoon, in accordance with Hitler's
            prior instructions, their remains were carried up the stairs through the bunker's
            emergency exit, doused in petrol, and set alight in the Reich Chancellery garden
            outside the bunker. In the following days, the remaining armed forces surrendered
            unconditionally.
