            Panzer IV Ausf. F2 (Sd.Kfz 161) 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The SdKfz 161 Panzerkampfwagen IV (PzKpfw IV) Medium Tank was developed to meet a 1934 
            requirement, from the German Army Weapons Department, for a close support tank of around 
            20 tons. It was required to be armed with a big-bore weapon better suited for usage against 
            "soft" targets, where the high-velocity armour-piercing 37mm guns or machine-guns of lighter 
            tanks would be unsuitable. As with the PzKpfw II and III tanks, various designs were submitted 
            by Rheinmetall-Borsig, MAN and Krupp companies. Some of these designs did not get off paper, 
            but following tests with prototype vehicles in 1935-1936, Krupp were awarded the contract for 
            development of a production model. In so doing they would provide the German armoured forces 
            with unquestionably the one of the finest and versatile tanks of the Second World War, and 
            one that would, through successive modifications, become the backbone of the Wehrmacht's 
            Panzer arm.

        </p>

        <p>
            Introduced in early 1942, the Ausf F-2 mounted, in a modified turret, the long-barrelled 75mm 
            KwK 40 L/43 gun in place of the L/24. The PzKpfw IV could now take on the task of the PzKpfw 
            III, namely that of fighting other tanks. The British in North Africa labeled the Ausf 
            F-2 model the "Panzer IV Special". Fortunately few were sent to Africa and even by the Battle 
            of El Alamein Rommel had only thirty-seven of this valuable weapon available.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the end of the war about 9,000 PzKpfw IV tanks had been built and it was the only German 
            tank to be in continuous production throughout the war years. Although outclassed by 1944, 
            and perhaps continued in production longer than was desirable. Nevertheless the PzKpfw IV 
            was still a most useful tank which could take on Shermans or Cromwells at roughly equal odds. 
            Whilst Improvements in armament and armour had been added as requirements changed, the basic 
            chassis had remained unaltered on all models - a tribute to the soundness of the original design. 
            Tanks which were returned to workshops for repair were regularly modified to the latest standard 
            and the whole fleet was progressively up-dated as the new versions were introduced.

           Sturmgeshutz III Ausf. E (Sd.Kfz 142)
        </h3>

        <p>
             The Sturmgeschütz III originated from German experiences in World War I when it was discovered 
             that during the offensives on the western front the infantry lacked the means to effectively 
             engage fortifications. The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up 
             with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor obstacles with 
             direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General Erich 
             von Manstein who is considered the father of the Sturmartillerie. This is because the initial 
             proposal was from (then) Colonel Erich von Manstein and submitted to General Ludwig Beck in 1935, 
             suggesting that Sturmartillerie ("assault artillery") units should be used in a direct-fire support 
             role for infantry divisions. On June 15, 1936, Daimler-Benz AG received an order to develop an armoured 
             infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a 75 mm artillery piece. The gun mount's fixed, fully 
             integrated casemate superstructure was to allow a limited traverse of a minimum of 25° and provided 
             overhead protection for the crew. The height of the vehicle was not to exceed that of the average man.

        </p>

        <p>
            While the StuG III was considered self-propelled artillery it was not initially clear which arm of the 
            Wehrmacht would handle the new weapon. The Panzer arm, the natural user of tracked fighting vehicles, 
            had no resources to spare for the formation of StuG units, and neither did the infantry branch. It was 
            agreed, after a discussion, it would best be employed as part of the artillery arm.

            The StuGs were organized into battalions and followed their own specific doctrine. Infantry support 
            using direct-fire was its intended role. Later there was also a strong emphasis on destroying enemy
            armour whenever encountered.
        </p>

        <p>
            As of April 10, 1945, there were 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s in service.

            The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared to the heavier German tanks, 
            though in the anti-tank role they were best used defensively, as the lack of a 
            traversable turret was a severe disadvantage in the assault role. As the German 
            military situation deteriorated later in the war, more StuG guns were built 
            compared to tanks, to replace losses and bolster defenses against the encroaching 
            Allied forces.

            In 1943 and 1944, the Finnish Army received a total of 59 StuG III Ausf. Gs from 
            Germany and used them against the Soviet Union. Thirty of the vehicles were received 
            in 1943 and 29 in 1944. The 1943 batch destroyed at least 87 enemy tanks for a loss 
            of only 8 StuGs. The 1944 batch saw no real action.

            ter the Second World War the Soviet Union donated some of their captured German vehicles to Syria, 
            which continued to use them along with other war surplus AFVs during the 1950s and up until the 
            War over Water against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the Six Days War all of them had 
            been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, or interred on the Golan Heights as static pillboxes.

        <h3>
            Jagdpanzer IV/70 (V) (Sd.Kfz 162)
        </h3>

        <p>
            The Jagdpanzer IV, Sd.Kfz. 162, was a Tank destroyer based on the Panzer IV chassis built in three main variants. 
            It was developed against the wishes of Heinz Guderian, the inspector general of the Panzertruppen, as a replacement 
            for the Stug III . Guderian objected against the needless, in his eyes, diversion of resources from Panzer IV tank 
            production, as the Stug III and Stug IV were still more than adequate for their role.

            Nevertheless in late 1942 the Wehrmacht's arms bureau, the Waffenamt, called for a new tank destroyer design based 
            on the Panzer IV, which would be armed with the same 75mmm gun as fitted to the Panther - the PaK 42 L/70 .

            Unlike previous tank destroyers like the Marder series, this gun was to be mounted directly into the Jagdpanzer's 
            superstructure, keeping its silhouette as low as possible.

            The Jagdpanzer IV kept the basis chassis of the Panzer IV tank, but the original vertical front plate was replaced 
            by a sharp edged nose. Internally, the layout was changed to accommodate the new superstructure, moving the fuel 
            tanks and ammunition racks. Because the Jagdpanzer lacked a turret, the engine which originally powered the 
            Panzer IV's turret could be eliminated.

        </p>

        <p>
            Jagdpanthers operated in individual heavy anti-tank battalions although rarely at full strength. 
            They saw their first combat action in Normandy during the early days of the invasion and then 
            participated in the Battle of the Bulge along with heavy action on the Eastern Front up to the 
            end of the war. Many historians have often compared its performance to that of the Soviet 
            SU-100 tank destroyer.

            In the later stages of the war however, they were increasingly used as tank substitutes, 
            because there was often nothing else available.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several Jagdpanthers survived the war and now reside in museums in Europe and
            America with three restored to running condition.
