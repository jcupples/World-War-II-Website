            A6M3 Zero
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Type 0 Carrier Fighter is the most maneuverable fighter aircraft in aviation history. 
            The Zero fighters were made out of lightweight duralumin alloy for maximum maneuverability. 
            Horikoshi and his team had to make sacrifices to achieve such high performance, especially 
            considering the relatively weak 950 horsepower powerplant. Armor plating and self-sealing 
            fuel tanks, for example, were deleted from the blueprint to save weight. On 23 Mar 1939, 
            a prototype Zero fighter was taken apart, loaded onto two ox carts, and moved about 25 miles 
            to the naval base of Kagamigahara, Japan, where it would take its maiden flight on 1 Apr. 
            The second prototype was delivered on 25 Oct 1939. Production began soon afterwards, with 
            the first production example delivered on 31 Jul 1940.

        </p>

        <p>
            Zero fighters were typically deployed in three-fighter flights, each called a shotai. 
            Unlike western flights, the Japanese flight leader flew far ahead of the two wingmen, 
            while the wingmen weaved left and right and up and down, covering more blind spots 
            than their western counterparts. When attacking, instead of the entire flight attacking 
            the target, the three Zero fighters would attack in succession, thus never giving the 
            target any chance for a break during the entire attack. When the flight was attacked, 
            however, the shotai, given the distance between the flight leader and the wingmen, was 
            easily broken up, leaving each fighter to fend for itself. Early in the war, when the 
            Zero fighters were by far the most maneuverable fighters, they relied on the 
            maneuverability to recover from the occasions when the flights were broken up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Toward the end of the Pacific War, the large numbers of Zero fighters in service and 
            their high maneuverability made them ideal for suicide special attacks, more popularly 
            known to westerners of the day as "kamikaze". Out of the 2,363 Japanese Navy aircraft 
            that participated in special attack missions, 1,189 of them were A6M Zero fighters.

            By the end of WW2, 10,937 Zero fighters were manufactured. Mitsubishi built only 3,880, 
            while the majority of the remainder were built by Nakajima, the company that declined 
            to bid on the original request for such a fighter.

            After the war, most surviving A6M Zero fighters were destroyed. A few of them were 
            sent to the United States for testing. Many of them were abandoned across the various 
            Pacific islands, rusting very quickly in jungle climates. Only 13 or so are available for 
            museum display and only a very small number remain in flyable conditions.

        <h3>
           Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu Kai Hei
        </h3>

        <p>
             In response to the rapid emergence in Europe of twin-engine heavy fighters such as the
              Messerschmitt Bf 110, the army ordered development of a twin-engine, two-seat fighter 
              in 1937, and assigned the proposal by Kawasaki Shipbuilding the designation of Ki-38. 
              This only went as far as a mock up, but by December of that year, the army ordered a 
              working prototype as the Ki-45, which first flew in January 1939. Results from the test 
              flights, however, did not meet the army's expectations. The Ha-20 Otsu engine was 
              underpowered and failure-prone, while the airframe suffered from nacelle stall.

              The Ki-45 did not enter service, but the army, insistent on having a working 
              twin-engine fighter, ordered Kawasaki to continue development. Kawasaki 
              responded by replacing the engines with the proven Nakajima Ha-25. Flight 
              tests were promising.

              In October 1940, the army ordered continued improvements such as switching 
              to 1,080 hp Mitsubishi Ha-102 engines. This craft, designated Ki-45 Kai, 
              was complete in September 1941 and was officially adopted for use by the army in 
              February 1942 as the "Type 2 Two-Seat Fighter".

        </p>

        <p>
            The first production type "Ko" was armed with two 12.7 mm Ho-103 
            machine gun in the nose, a single Type 97 20 mm cannon in the belly offset 
            to the right, and a trainable 7.92 mm machine gun in the rear cabin, 
            and this was followed with the Otsu with the lower 20 mm cannon replaced by a 37 mm 
            type 94 tank gun, to counter B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. While the firepower was 
            devastating, manual reloading meant that only two rounds could be fired per minute. 
            The next type "Hei" restored the 20 mm cannon, and this time placed an automatic 37 mm
            gun in the nose. A later addition in the "tei" type were twin obliquely-firing 20 mm 
            Ho-5 cannons behind the cockpit and often propulsive exhaust stacks.

        <p>
            he Ki-45 was initially used as a long-range bomber escort. The 84th Independent 
            Flight Wing (Dokuritsu Hikō Chutai) used them in June 1942 in attacks on Guilin, 
            where they encountered, but were no match for Curtiss P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers. 
            In September of the same year, they met P-40s over Hanoi with similar results. 
            It became clear that the Ki-45 could not hold its own against single-engine fighters in aerial combat.

            It was subsequently deployed in several theaters in the roles of interception, attack 
            and fleet defense. Its greatest strength turned out to be as an anti-bomber interceptor, 
            as was the case of the Bf 110 in Europe. 
            In New Guinea, the IJAAF used the aircraft in an anti-ship role, where the Ki-45 
            was heavily armed with one 37 mm and two 20 mm cannons and could carry 
            two 250 kg bombs on hard points under the wings. 1,675 Ki-45s of all versions
            were produced during the war.

        <h3>
            Ki-49IIa Donryu
        </h3>

        <p>
            The Ki-49 was designed to replace the Mitsubishi Ki-21, which entered service 
            in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in 1938. Learning from service trials 
            of the Ki-21, the Army realized that however advanced it may have been at the 
            time of its introduction, its new Mitsubishi bomber would in due course be unable 
            to operate without fighter escorts. As a result the Japanese Army stipulated that 
            its replacement should have the speed and defensive weaponry to enable it to operate 
            independently. The prototype first flew in August 1939 and the development programme 
            continued through three prototypes and seven pre-production aircraft. This first 
            prototype was powered by a pair of 950 hp Nakajima Ha-5 KA-I radial engines, 
            but the next two had the 1,250 hp Nakajima Ha-41 engines that were intended 
            for the production version. Seven more prototypes were built, and these completed the 
            test programme for the aircraft. Eventually in March 1941, the Donryu went into production 
            as the Army Type 100 Heavy Bomber Model 1.

        </p>

        <p>
            WGoing operational from autumn 1941, the Ki-49 first saw service in China. 
            After the outbreak of the Pacific War it was also active in the New Guinea 
            area and in raids on Australia. Like the prototype, these early versions 
            were armed with five 7.7 mm machine guns and one 20 mm cannon. Combat 
            experience in China and New Guinea showed the Donryu to be underpowered, 
            with bomb capacity and speed suffering as a result. Thus, in the spring 
            of 1942 an up-engined version was produced, fitted with more powerful 
            Ha-109 engines, and this became the production Army Type 100 Heavy Bomber 
            Model 2 or Ki-49-IIa. The Model 2 also introduced improved armour and 
            self-sealing fuel tanks and was followed by the Ki-49-IIb in which 12.7 mm
            machine guns replaced three of the 7.7 mm pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            In spite of these improvements however, losses continued to mount as the 
            quantity and quality of fighter opposition rose. An attempt was made to 
            stop the rot in early 1943 by further up-engining the type. This petered out, 
            however, owing to development difficulties with the 2,420 hp Nakajima Ha-117 
            engines and the Ki-49-III never entered production with only six prototypes 
            ever being built.

            In the face of its increasing vulnerability to opposing fighter aircraft 
            while performing its intended role, the Ki-49 was used in other roles 
            towards the end of the Pacific War, including ASW patrol, troop 
            transport and, ultimately, as kamikaze.

            After 819 aircraft had been completed, production ended in December 1944.
