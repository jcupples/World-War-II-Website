           Type 95 Ha-Go
        </h3>
        <p>
           The Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks were developed in the early 1930s to bridge a weakness 
           in the Japanese Army which had no tanks that were fast enough to travel with its 
           infantry-carrying trucks. The first prototype of the Type 95 Ha-Go design was 
           completed in 1934 at the Japanese Army's Sagami Arsenal. In 1935, the design was 
           accepted for service. The Japanese Army leadership agreed that despite weaknesses, 
           this new light tank design was not only superior to current Japanese tanks available, 
           it was only among one of the better light tank designs at the time. Production began 
           later that year by the Sagami Arsenal, Kokura Arsenal, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
           Hitachi Industries, Niigata Tekkosho, and Kobe Seikosho.

        <p>
            In the opening chapters of the Pacific War, Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks were found to 
            be sufficient against the few tanks that the United Kingdom operated in Malaya and 
            Singapore and also sufficient when facing American M3 Lee light tanks in the Philippine 
            Islands. Both Type 95 Ha-Go and M3 Lee tanks had 37-millimeter guns, while the Japanese 
            tanks had thinner armor plating; however, when the two types of tanks faced each other 
            on 22 Dec 1941 in the Philippine Islands, the Japanese tanks had the upper hand due to 
            better training. Although they handled the Malayan jungles very well, when brought to 
            the more southerly Pacific Islands, they quickly became bogged down in the wetter terrain. 
            This happened right from the start when the first two Type 95 Ha-Go tanks were deployed 
            to Milne Bay, New Guinea, and both of them were abandoned within days of landing because
            they were so deep in mud. Later in the war, when the British, Commonwealth, and American 
            forces began to bring in heavier tanks such as the Matilda infantry tanks, M3 Stuart light 
            tanks, and the M4 Sherman medium tanks, they were essentially obsolete as their primary
            guns were too small and the armor plating were too weak. Due to necessity, they continued 
            to be the main light tanks of the Japanese Army through the final year of the war, but as 
            the end neared, more and more of them were dug in as static pillboxes as they were not able 
            to stand up to Allied forces from both quantity and quality perspectives.

        <p>
            Between 1940 and 1942, the Japanese Navy took several examples of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank 
            design and developed the Type 2 Ka-Mi amphibious tank design. They were intended for use by the 
            Special Naval Landing Forces for amphibious assault operations. The Navy engineers replaced all 
            the rivets with wielding with rubber seals, and added steel plate pontoons to the front and rear 
            of the tanks to provide buoyancy. Each of the Type 2 Ka-Mi amphibious tanks were driven by a pair 
            of propellers, located at the bottom rear of the vehicle and operated by the tank commander located 
            inside the turret. Occasionally the Type 2 Ka-Mi tanks were equipped with torpedoes, but for the 
            most part they fielded similar armament as their Type 95 Ha-Go cousins. Because of the complexity 
            of the design, the Type 2 Ka-Mi amphibious tanks were nearly completely hand-made, thus only 184 
            units were built. When they were introduced in late 1942, most of the amphibious invasion by the 
            Japanese forces had been completed, thus they did not serve in their intended amphibious assault 
            roles. Instead, they were assigned to naval garrison detachments for defensive roles very similar 
            to the Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks.

           Type 92 Jyo-Sokosha
        </h3>

        <p>
             After World War I, many European countries attempted to mechanize their cavalry. In parallel, 
             Japanese cavalry also experimented with a variety of armored cars with limited success. 
             These wheeled armored cars were not suitable for most operations in Manchuria, due to the 
             poor road conditions and severe winter climate. Japan's army (like the US, French, British 
             and Russian armies) tried various methods to integrate modern armor into their traditional 
             horse cavalry formations.

            From the early 1920s, the Imperial Japanese Army Cavalry School based in Chiba prefecture 
            tested a variety of European light tanks, including six Carden Loyd tankettes and several 
            Renault FTs, and a decision was reached in 1929 to proceed with the domestic development of 
            a new vehicle, based largely on the Carden Loyd design and intended to address the deficiencies 
            of wheeled armored cars.

        </p>

        <p>
            The development of the Type 92 began with a hybrid amphibious car; this had both tracks and 
            wheels and was able to drive in forward and reverse, both in the water and on land. The 
            experiment was not entirely successful, and the Japanese cavalry was not impressed with 
            the performance. After this, the amphibious car concept was abandoned, and the design was 
            changed to a tracked vehicle for land use only.

            Production was initiated by Ishikawajima Motorcar Manufacturing Company in 1932. 
            Production was plagued by technical problems and in total only 167 units were built 
            between 1932 and 1939. After some initial problems with the running gear, the Type 92 
            proved well suited for the rough terrain and poor roads of Manchuria and China, and was 
            able to attain a speed of 40 km/h. Some vehicles were equipped with two searchlights 
            for night operations and Type 94 Mk 4 Otsu radios.

            The Type 92 was eventually replaced by the Type 94 Te Ke during the Second 
            Sino-Japanese War, although both British and American sources often confused 
            the two models.
        </p>

        <p>
            After production ended, efforts were made to improve the armament to keep the vehicle 
            relevant on the battlefield. The Type 98 20 mm Machine Cannon was successfully mounted 
            on the hull of a number of the vehicles, in place of the 13.2 mm machine gun. Attempts 
            were also made to mount a 37 mm tank gun on the vehicle with lesser success. In addition, 
            an external anti-aircraft mount was stowed in the vehicle, which could be attached to the 
            outer rear facing of the turret, allowing an additional Type 91 or Type 97 tank machine 
            gun to be mounted. The engine hatches could be opened and locked together to form a seat 
            for the gunner using the externally mounted machine gun.

            Type 97 Chi-Ha
        </h3>

        <p>
            In the mid-1930s, the Type 89 Chi-Ro medium tanks were considered obsolete. The Japanese Army 
            infantry commanders requested a tank design that could travel at the speed of 35 kilometers 
            per hour in order to keep up with the infantry-carrying trucks that were becoming more 
            commonplace. The Tokyo factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries completed an experimental 
            vehicle designated Chi-Ha and the Japanese Army's Osaka Arsenal came up with Chi-Ni. The 
            Mitsubishi model was more expensive; it weighed 13.5 metric tons due to the generally thicker 
            armor. The Osaka Arsenal design had a cheaper price tag; it weighed 9.8 metric tons, and the 
            thicket armor was at the turret front at 25 millimeters. In late 1937, the Mitsubishi design 
            was accepted.

        </p>

        <p>
            In 1941, development of a new 47-millimeter gun design with higher muzzle velocity was completed. 
            From 1942 onwards, newly built Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks were equipped with these new tank guns, 
            which were mated with larger turrets; these tanks were designated Type 97 Shinhoto Chi-Ha medium tanks.

            As the Pacific War progressed, Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks were used more and more as static pillboxes 
            as they were not on par with better Allied tanks such as the American M4 Sherman medium tanks.
            One exception, however, took place in Jun 1944 on Saipan of the Mariana Islands, where 36 of these 
            tanks of the 9th Tank Regiment and a number of Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks of 
            the 136th Infantry Regiment conducted a major counter-offensive.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the course of the production life, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries built 1,224 Type 97 Chi-Ha medium 
            tanks, Hitachi Industries built 355, and Japanese Army's arsenals built the rest. In all, 2,123 were 
            built between 1938 and 1943; 1,162 of them were the original design, 930 were of the improved Type 97 
            Shinhoto Chi-Ha design, and the remainder were various experimental or specialized variants. Production 
            ceased at the end of 1943 as the Type 1 Chi-He medium tank became the replacement design.


            After the war, Chinese forces on both sides of the civil war operated a significant number of captured 
            Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks. The communist Chinese examples were in use until as late as 1949.
