        <h2>
            The Empire of Japan
        </h2>
        <h3>
            The Invasion of China and Her People
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 1931, Japan, eager for the vast natural resources to be found in China and seeing
            her obvious weakness, invaded and occupied Manchuria. It was turned into a nominally
            independent state called Manchukuo, but the Chinese Emperor who ruled it was a puppet
            of the Japanese. When China appealed to the League of Nations to intervene, the
            League published the Lytton Report which condemned Japanese aggression. The only
            real consequence of this was that an outraged Japanese delegation stormed out of
            the League of Nations, never to return.</p>
        <p>
            In 1937 skirmishing between Japanese and Chinese troops on the frontier led to what
            became known as the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. This fighting sparked a full-blown
            conflict, the Second Sino-Japanese War. Under the terms of the Sian Agreement, the
            Chinese Nationalists (KMT) and the CCP now agreed to fight side by side against
            Japan. The Communists had been encouraged to negotiate with the KMT by Stalin, who
            saw Japan as an increasing threat on his Far Eastern border, and began supplying
            arms to China. China also received aid from western democracies, where public opinion
            was strongly anti-Japanese. Britain, France and the US all sent aid (the latter
            including the famous ‘Flying Tigers’ fighter-pilot volunteers). Because of historic
            ties, China also received aid from Nazi Germany for a short period, until Hitler
            decided to make an alliance with Japan in 1938.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the Japanese quickly captured all key Chinese ports and industrial centres,
            including cities such as the Chinese capital Nanking and Shanghai, CCP and KMT forces
            continued resisting. In the brutal conflict, both sides used ‘scorched earth’ tactics.
            Massacres and atrocities were common. The most infamous came after the fall of Nanking
            in December 1937, when Japanese troops slaughtered an estimated 300,000 civilians
            and raped 80,000 women. Many thousands of Chinese were killed in the indiscriminate
            bombing of cities by the Japanese air force. There were also savage reprisals carried
            out against Chinese peasants, in retaliation for attacks by partisans who waged
            a guerrilla war against the invader, ambushing supply columns and attacking isolated
            units. Warfare of this nature led, by the war’s end, to an estimated 10 to 20 million
            Chinese civilians deaths.</p>

        <h3>
            The Unprovoked Attack on Pearl Harbor
        </h3>
        <p>
            Shortly before 8am on Sunday 7 December 1941, the first of two waves of Japanese
            aircraft launched a devastating attack on the US Pacific Fleet, moored at Pearl
            Harbor in Hawaii. The raid, which came with no warning and no declaration of war,
            destroyed four battleships and damaged four more in just two hours. It also destroyed
            188 US aircraft. While 100 Japanese perished in the attack, more than 2,400 Americans
            were killed, with another 1,200 injured.</p>
        <p>
            The causes of the attack on Pearl Harbor stemmed from intensifying Japanese-American
            rivalry in the Pacific. Japan’s imperial ambitions had been evident from as early
            as 1931, when she invaded Manchuria. The conquered region’s bountiful resources
            were then used to supply Japan’s war machine. Leaving the League of Nations in 1933,
            Japan pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at creating the ‘Greater East Asia
            Co-prosperity Sphere’, a euphemism for a Japanese empire modelled on European ones
            of the 19th century.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Japanese achieved complete surprise at Pearl Harbor, something that can largely
            be attributed to failures in US intelligence. Although the US had cracked Japanese
            radio codes, in this case the raw data was not interpreted correctly by army and
            navy. Although the attack pummelled American battleships, US aircraft carriers escaped
            unscathed. This was critical because the Pacific Fleet would have been virtually
            incapable of operating without them.</p>
        <p>
            Pearl Harbor appeared to be a huge success for Japan. It was followed by rapid Japanese
            conquests in Hong Kong, Singapore, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya and New Guinea.
            Yet in the long term, the attack was strategically catastrophic. The ‘sleeping giant’
            had been awoken, and in America, a sense of fury now accompanied the mobilisation
            for war of the world’s most powerful economy. The losses at Pearl Habor would soon
            be more than made good, and used to take a terrible vengeance on Japan.</p>

        <h3>
            Battle at Midway: A Turning Point.
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Battle of Midway was a decisive episode in the struggle for naval hegemony in
            the Pacific Ocean, fought in June 1942. As a result of the Battle of the Coral Sea,
            which had taken place a month earlier, Japanese Pacific expansion had been temporarily
            halted. Now Japanese admiral Isoruko Yamamoto wanted to force a decisive clash in
            the Pacific before US industrial power was fully mobilised against Japan. His chosen
            location was Midway Atholl, a small and solitary archipelago northeast of Hawaii.
            Yamamoto knew that the US would defend Midway to the bitter end. If the archipelago
            fell, Hawaii would fall within range of Japanese aircraft, allowing Japan to invade
            within a matter of weeks.</p>
        <p>
            Yamamoto knew that the US’s Pacific aircraft carriers would be despatched to protect
            the islands; he hoped to lure them into a trap and destroy them. The Japanese occupation
            of Midway was also part of a plan to push out her defensive perimeter after the
            Doolittle Raid: a dramatic propaganda air attack on Tokyo launched from the carrier
            USS Hornet. Furthermore, the Japanese hoped a decisive, humiliating and demoralising
            defeat in the Pacific would force America to negotiate an end to the war on terms
            beneficial to Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yamamoto’s plans were scuppered by two principle factors. Firstly, the Japanese
            underestimated the US’s naval strength. They were unaware that the US Yorktown -
            which had been badly damaged during the Battle of the Coral Sea - had been repaired
            and was back in action. Secondly, American code breakers were able to determine
            the exact date and location of the attack. This allowed US Admiral Chester Nimitz
            to weave an elaborate web of decoy tactics and to plan a deadly pre-emptive ambush.
            This main US attack, which began at 10:26 on the morning of 4 June, took the Japanese
            by surprise and succeeded in destroying four aircraft carriers in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p>
            The US Navy inflicted irreversible and debilitating damage upon the Japanese fleet.
            In contrast, the US lost just one aircraft carrier and a destroyer. Although a number
            of Japanese pilots did survive, many of the highly trained maintenance teams who
            ensured the efficiency of ships and aircraft perished in the battle. These heavy
            losses permanently weakened the Japanese armed forces. While the US continued to
            construct ships and train new pilots at a huge rate, Midway inflicted losses on
            the Japanese from which she could not recover. From this point on, the US enjoyed
            indisputable naval superiority in the Pacific.</p>

        <h3>
            Hiroshima and Nagasaki's Destruction: Japan's Unconditional Surrender
        </h3>
        <p>
            At approximately 8.15am on 6 August 1945 a US B-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb
            on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. Three
            days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000
            more. The dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of US President
            Harry Truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. In the months following
            the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result
            of radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>
            The effects of the attack were devastating. The predicted Japanese surrender, which
            came on 15 August - just six days after the detonation over Nagasaki - ended World
            War II. Yet the shocking human effects soon led many to cast doubts upon the use
            of this weapon. The first western scientists, servicemen and journalists to arrive
            on the scene produced vivid and heartrending reports describing a charred landscape
            populated by hideously burnt people, coughing up and urinating blood and waiting
            to die.
